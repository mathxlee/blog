Always get a lot of stuff.
Maybe this is also your status, how to find the gap between things is a huge problem, the most important thing I think is a plan.
You will say, plans never get solved. This is because sometimes we set a enormous target.
Actually, the vitally step to drawing up a plan is analyze your plan and split it up into a lot of tiny mini plan and pick up the feasibiliy parts. Like I wanna read 50 books a year. Trust me, if you are not an perseverance kinda guy you are never be a reader, or even you will never accomplish a book reading task.
So, the `REAL PLAN` you need is reading a book in a week, or reading 20 pages of a book per day.
Then find out a way to persist it and find out a way to be happy, happy is the core, it will let you insist it for a long time.

Time just like delicious dessert, it would never be loath.
I really hope that I could have a lot of time to learn and never get tired and never die, huh huh, that’s enough.

Today’s toy is [clipboard.js].
[clipboard.js](https://github.com/zenorocha/clipboard.js): As your seen, the name means your can copy things to clipboard, but the different part with other similar libraries is that this library make it true without Flash(Hoooooo), and of course it `can not support any old IE browsers (IE9-)`, but the official web site offers some compatible solution, you can check it out if you are interest in.
