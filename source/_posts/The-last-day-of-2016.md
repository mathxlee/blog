I hate to say that, but Time is running really fast.

Here is the toys what I recommand to you guys today:

[Riot.js](http://riotjs.com/): Simple and elegant component-based UI library. I don’t know what is the future of this library or framework or whatever you called, but I really like the thinking way of the author’s mind, and I think, Combining all the HTML, CSS, JS into a component is the future.

Browser Compatibity: IE9+ and all the modern browsers.

Now it’s the last day of 2016, it’s really a tough year and I really go through a lot my life this year, and I hope everyone will get whatever their want in new lifetime.
