What you can not believe is that now is 2018, and you are getting older.

You still hold a lot of dreams and they are not come true yet.

You wanna read a lot of books but you just did a little reading excursion and give up at last.

You wanna travel to a place far away with your real life and always on the road to the beautiful place but you just step into some spiral buiding and shout that everything is too tired to continue in the end.

You wanna resist the lazy of your body to lose some weight but you would rather lay back your bed and watched some shows eventually.

We always complain life is way too cruel but we did nothing and just go with it.

It's the genuine 2018 now, I just hope I still be the guy who never acommodate the mundane world and be myself even kind of controversial.

Hope everyone got a great year.



Well, today's toy is [eruda](https://github.com/liriliri/eruda), it's a very useful tool for developing mobile web page, it will simulate a console panel in your mobile window and you could debug there, very cool, and easy installing also.
