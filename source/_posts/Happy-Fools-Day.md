Well well well, today is fools’ day.

AAMOF, there is another name call `fools` in Chinese, we called it `ShaBi`. Like most Chinese words, it also has two aspects meaning, the good part that we use it to those who always do the dumb thing in a cute way, the bad part we use it to mean the people who do the stupid stuff without caring any consequences.

Most time I really don’t care the ShaBi, but you know, sometimes we just mess up with these people, WE MADE FRIENDS WITH THEM!!! Just like people said, `You treat them good, they just think you are an idiot; you treat them like a lover, they treat you like a bullshit`. Then, I don’t like ‘ShaBi’, but we have to live with them. So… BE WITH IT!

Thanks for hearing what I complained here, here is the real shit I wanna recommand, and it’s today’s really toy:
