​	My life almost past thirty years. 

​	Sometimes I hate that number, its like a curse. it means you need to accept a lot a thing what the human being society force me to accept, like getting married, like what you should be in the age of this number. It was just like telling you that you are not young any more, like a message what is telling you that you have gone throught half time of your life. Honestly, I don't like it.

​	The most sad part is not your age, its about your parents, the people you love with, they are getting older like you, and you are just afraid that what will happen to all of your life.

​	Last year of my life is really happened a lot of things, betrayed by my best friend, got into the hospital, dispatched into a bad department of the company, got the bad mood and bad health and bad job status. But the only thing I can do is still to thank everything.

​	I hope there is still a little hope grow in my heart, a little green piece, I will be strong, and hold the hope to see my green new days.
